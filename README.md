# Sentimental-analysis-using-Natural-Language-Processing
Sentiment Analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and categorizing opinions or emotions expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used to determine whether the sentiment behind a text is positive, negative, or neutral.
I applied techniques like tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging using Pythonâ€™s NLTK library, and integrated graph-based sentiment visualizations to make insights easier to interpret for decision-making.
